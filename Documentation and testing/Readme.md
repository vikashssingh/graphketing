Fair Distribution Algorithm Documentation
Introduction
The Fair Distribution Algorithm is designed to evenly distribute work sites among electricians, ensuring each electrician has a fair share of work. This prevents situations where some electricians are overloaded while others have little to do.

Preparation
Understanding Requirements: Begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements of the system. Identify the need for fair distribution of work sites among electricians.

Research: Conduct research on algorithms and strategies for fair distribution of resources among multiple entities.

Data Modeling: Model the data structures required for the algorithm. This includes defining the schema for electricians and work sites.

Implementation
Calculate Workload: Determine the workload by calculating the number of work sites available and the number of active electricians.

Calculate Average: Calculate the average number of sites per electrician by dividing the total number of sites by the total number of electricians.

Distribute Sites: Distribute sites among electricians based on the calculated average. Ensure each electrician receives an equal or nearly equal number of sites.

Handle Remainder: If there is a remainder in the distribution, allocate the extra sites to electricians until all sites are assigned.

Update Electrician Records: Update the electrician records with the assigned work sites.

Testing: Thoroughly test the algorithm with different scenarios to ensure fair distribution and proper handling of edge cases.

Usage
To use the Fair Distribution Algorithm:

Pass the list of electricians and the list of work sites to the distributeSites function.
Retrieve the updated electrician records containing the assigned work sites.
Implement appropriate error handling and logging to handle any exceptions or unexpected scenarios.
Conclusion
The Fair Distribution Algorithm provides an efficient and fair solution for distributing work sites among electricians. By evenly distributing the workload, it helps optimize resource utilization and maintain a balanced workload across the workforce.
